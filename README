there are two main executables

find_hash_tags.py and find_tweets.py

i'm running ubuntu 11.04 with python and mysql setup
your mysql login informatino needs to be defined in mysql_config.py
rename mysql_config.py.bak to mysql_config.py and modify the obvious config parameters

in the beginning of find_hash_tags is the sql schema necessary to start this service

you basically want to run both find_hash_tags and find_tweets simultaneously

find_hash_tags searches twitter for #ows, #occupywallst, and #occupywallstreet
and finds 'co-occuring tags' in tweets with those three hashtags that starts with 'occupy'
adds them to a hash_tags database in mysql

find_tweets searches twitter for the hash tags in the mysql database and adds it to a flat file

this flat log file is rotated and gzipped every half hour

currently no work is undertaken to parse the flat file, that is the next immediate TODO
however what is accomplished is archiving of tweets related to #ows
